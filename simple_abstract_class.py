# To start with ABC you should:
#
# import the abc module;
# make your base class inherit the helper class ABC, which is
# delivered by the abc module;
# decorate abstract methods with @abstractmethod, which is
# delivered by the abc module.
# When you run the code, the output doesnâ€™t surprise anyone:

import abc

gf.hello()

# Outputs...
# Welcome to Green Field!

# You can not instantiate the BluePrint class!!!!
# bp = BluePrint()

# Will output...
# Traceback (most recent call last):
